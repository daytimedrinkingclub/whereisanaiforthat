# Whereisanaiforthat

- Inspired from all the confused and why memes we are building a listing directory which only lists AI tools which work a 100% of the time.
  - There are a lot of AI tools which do not work at all
  - We will use and vet all the AI tools ourselves and then list them here

## Technology stack to be used

- Self Hosted supabase for storing the data and get all listing
- Flask for the backend
- Jinja2 for the templating
- Bootstrap CSS

    id bigint generated by default as identity,
    created_at timestamp with time zone not null default now(),
    tool_name text null,
    tool_details text null,
    tool_core_features character varying null default ''::character varying,
